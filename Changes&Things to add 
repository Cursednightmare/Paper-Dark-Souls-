(Vince:2/3/20)I made some tweaks to a few things i also got rid of the thing i was working on. Im trying to do the attacks and stuff for the enemies and character. Kyle i think you should do tweaks for the sub-classes or whatever i guess. We need to cover way more ground if were going to finish.
(Vince:2/25/20) I added the attacks and killing the enemies. We need to add drops now.

THINGS WE HAVE TO DO:
1: Invetory thing/pick up function
2. Work on the other rooms
3. Turn based system attacking
4. Get a girlfriend(-w-)
